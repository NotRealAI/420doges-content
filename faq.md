  <b>Who built this?</b> And why?
</h3>
</summary>

The short answer is I was feeling inspired ðŸ¥¬ on 4/20 (aka Doge Day). 

The long answer is I'm a developer who has been building and experimenting with projects at the intersection of generative AI and Ethereum. You can check out my Instagram account at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/notreal.ai/'>@notreal.ai</a>.

I believe that building projects like these is my best shot at making a positive impact in the world. I also just enjoy doing it. I hope that you enjoy it and and that the care and effort that went into it shines through. 

I think making art is one of the best usages of AI, since it amplifies human creativity. I'd like to continue building sites that intersect generative AI and the decentralized web and which benefit the Doge, Ethereum, NFT and global communities. Buying an NFT from this site helps me to continue pursuing that mission.

  <b>What is an NFT?</b> And why would I buy one?
</h3>
</summary>

You can think of an NFT as a digital trading card. Just like physical trading cards, the value comes down to a combination of its inherent value to you, plus what someone else will pay for it.

What makes NFTs different than physical trading cards is that they are natively digital. That means you never have to worry about it maybe being inauthentic. When you're trading one, you never have to worry about the other party not holding up their end of the deal. All of that is enforced digitally, making them easier to handle and trust with high amounts of value.

The other benefit of being natively digital is that they are inherently connected to the markets and liquidity of digital currency. Every day, more than 100 billion USD worth of digital currency changes hands. The simple fact that NFTs exist on the same global marketplace as these currencies them easier to trade for large amounts of value.


Because there is no physical item to ship, NFTs can be bought and then sold in a matter of minutes. That means that as long as someone feels confident they can sell it for slightly more than they bought it, short-term holders are willing to pay whatever price the NFT currently at. This is especially true for a zero-cost trading market such as ours. This means that NFTs should quickly find the price that they are worth, which is beneficial to anyone trying to make a purchasing decision.

  <b>How is this related to Dogecoin?</b> And what is RenDoge?
</h3>
</summary>

RenDoge is simply a way to use your Dogecoin on Ethereum. 1 RenDoge = 1 Dogecoin. The price of the two coins will always be the same.

The folks over at <a href='https://renproject.io/' target='_blank'>RenVM</a> built a way to securely wrap your Dogecoin into an Ethereum token. They do this for many other tokens as well, including Bitcoin.

It costs a 0.15% fee to wrap your Dogecoin and 0.1% fee to unwrap. However this is a pretty reasonable cost to get acccess to the entire Ethereum ecosystem.

  <b>How is this related to Ethereum?</b> And what is Polygon?
</h3>
</summary>

Polygon is a child blockchain of Ethereum. Anything you can run on Ethereum can also run on Polygon, but faster and cheaper. For example, a transaction on Ethereum might be 1000x - 10000x cheaper on Polygon.

You can move NFTs and tokens between Polygon and Ethereum through a bridge. Most tokens are bridged on <a href='https://wallet.matic.today/bridge/'>Polygon bridge site</a> but newer tokens must be added first. NFTs have to be bridged through a custom UI.

You have to pay transaction fees with Polygon tokens, just like you have to pay Ethereum gas fees with ETH. But transactions on Polygon are so cheap that you can get more than enough for free through a <a href='https://matic.supply/'>Polygon token faucet like this one</a>.

Polygon used to be called Matic, so you can think of 'Matic' and 'Polygon' as pretty much interchangeable.
