  When your NFT goes up in value and you sell it for renDoge, it's the same as if you had sold it for Dogecoin.

  There are some fees for using renDoge, a 0.25% fee for converting dogecoin -> renDoge and a 0.1% fee for converting dogecoin -> renDoge. In addition, there is a miner fee of about ~$3 at the time of this writing.

  To help cover these conversion costs, your first NFT purchase on the site is discounted by 42 doge, which is enough to cover the conversion costs of 10000 doge -> renDoge.
